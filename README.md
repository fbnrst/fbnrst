# Hi, I'm Fabian ðŸ‘‹

I'm a biophysicist and staff scientist in bioinformatics at [MPI CBG](https://www.mpi-cbg.de/), working on NGS data analysis in the [Meri Huch Lab](https://www.mpi-cbg.de/research-groups/current-groups/meri-huch). Fan of **Open Science**, data analysis, and computational biology.

I need to write this README to get a free voucher for GitHub. If you are a researcher as well, [you can get one too](https://education.github.com/discount_requests/application).
